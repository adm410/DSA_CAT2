# Q2. Differentiate between arrays and linked lists.

### 1. Memory Allocation
- Arrays- Allocate memory in a contiguous block which means all elements are stored together next to each other.<br>
The size of the array is fixed once it is created, meaning that you cannot change the size of the array without creating a new one.
- Linked Lists- Allocates memory dynamically as nodes are created so it can grow and shrink in size as needed<br>
Each node contains the data and a reference (or a pointer) to the next node in the list.

### 2. Performance
- Arrays- Access time is very fast because elements are stored in contiguous memory, allowing constant time access to any element via its index, with a time complexity of $O(1)$.
- Linked Lists- Access time is slower because elements are scattered in memory.<br>
To access an element, you need to traverse the list from the head node, resulting in a time complexity of $O(n)$.

### 3. Insertion and Deletion
- Arrays- Inserting or deleting an element is slow, especially if done in the middle or the beginning, as elements need to be shifted. This can take $O(n)$ time.
- Linked Lists- Insertion and deletion are quicker as you simply adjust the pointers.<br>
In the best case, these operations can be performed in $O(1)$ time if you already have a reference to the node.
